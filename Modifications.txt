Changes to make CFD
________________________________________________
-Modify source terms in CFD for width accounting (experiment with straight channel)
-Brinkman Drag Term formulation 
-Add a porosity gradient on the walls for MMA
-Add Eigen locally in the same directory as the fluid solver main
-Make the CFD solver faster when solving matrix. (use library used in thermal)
